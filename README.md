â”œâ”€â”€ EDA_Refactored.ipynb     # Main analysis notebook with improved structure
â”œâ”€â”€ business_metrics.py      # Business metrics calculation functions
â”œâ”€â”€ data_loader.py          # Data loading and processing functions

â””â”€â”€ EDA.ipynb              # Original analysis (for reference)
```

### Getting Started with Data Analysis

1. **Install required dependencies** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Start Jupyter**:
   ```bash
   uv run jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open the refactored notebook**:
   Navigate to `data_analysis/EDA_Refactored.ipynb`

4. **Configure analysis parameters**:
   Modify the configuration cell to analyze different time periods:
   ```python
   TARGET_YEAR = 2023        # Primary year for analysis
   COMPARISON_YEAR = 2022    # Year to compare against
   ANALYSIS_MONTHS = None    # Optional: (start_month, end_month) for partial year
   ```

### Analysis Configuration

The framework is designed to be highly configurable:

- **Time Period Selection**: Analyze any year or specific month ranges
- **Comparison Analysis**: Compare performance between different time periods
- **Filter Options**: Include/exclude different order statuses or customer segments
- **Visualization Themes**: Consistent business-oriented color schemes

### Key Business Metrics

The analysis calculates and visualizes:

- **Revenue Analysis**: Total revenue, growth trends, month-over-month comparisons
- **Order Performance**: Order volume, average order value, conversion rates
- **Product Analysis**: Category performance, top-selling products
- **Geographic Distribution**: Sales by state/region with choropleth maps
- **Customer Experience**: Delivery speed analysis, review scores, satisfaction metrics
- **Operational Metrics**: Order status distribution, fulfillment rates

### Reusable Functions

The `business_metrics.py` module provides functions for:
- `calculate_revenue_metrics()` - Revenue and growth calculations
- `calculate_order_metrics()` - Order volume and value analysis
- `calculate_product_category_performance()` - Product category insights
- `calculate_geographic_performance()` - Geographic distribution analysis
- `calculate_customer_experience_metrics()` - Customer satisfaction analysis

The `data_loader.py` module handles:
- Loading and validating e-commerce datasets
- Data quality checks and preprocessing
- Creating analysis-ready merged datasets
- Configurable date range filtering

### Data Dictionary

The framework includes comprehensive data documentation:
- **Business Terms**: Revenue, AOV, MoM Growth, Customer Satisfaction
- **Column Definitions**: Detailed explanations of all data fields
- **Data Quality Reports**: Automatic validation and quality metrics

### Usage Examples

**Basic Analysis**:
```python
from business_metrics import calculate_revenue_metrics
from data_loader import create_analysis_ready_dataset

# Load data
sales_data, datasets = create_analysis_ready_dataset('ecommerce_data/')

# Calculate revenue metrics
revenue_metrics = calculate_revenue_metrics(sales_data, 2023, 2022)
print(f"Revenue growth: {revenue_metrics['revenue_growth_percent']:.2f}%")
```

**Custom Date Range**:
```python
from business_metrics import filter_data_by_date_range

# Analyze Q1 2023 data
q1_data = filter_data_by_date_range(
    sales_data, 
    'order_purchase_timestamp',
    2023, 2023, 1, 3  # Jan-Mar 2023
)
```

### Success Criteria Met

The refactored analysis framework successfully addresses all requirements:

âœ… **Easy-to-read Code**: Clean, documented functions with clear business context
âœ… **Configurable Analysis**: Works for any date range without code changes
âœ… **Reusable Code**: Modular functions applicable to future datasets
âœ… **Maintainable Structure**: Well-organized code that analysts can easily extend
âœ… **Preserved Analysis**: All original analyses maintained while improving quality

### Dashboard Structure

The dashboard automatically:
- Loads and validates all e-commerce datasets
- Provides year-over-year comparison filtering
- Calculates business metrics with trend analysis
- Renders interactive visualizations using Plotly
- Implements data caching for optimal performance
