# RAG Chatbot Diagnostic Report

## Executive Summary
**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Configuration bug causing all queries to fail

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. PRIMARY BUG: MAX_RESULTS = 0 ⚠️
**File**: `backend/config.py:21`  
**Issue**: `MAX_RESULTS: int = 0` causes all vector searches to return empty results  
**Impact**: This is the root cause of "query failed" errors across the entire system

### 2. Flow Impact Analysis
```
User Query → RAGSystem → AIGenerator → CourseSearchTool → VectorStore.search()
                                                            ↓
                                                    max_results=0
                                                            ↓
                                                   Returns 0 results
                                                            ↓
                                              "No relevant content found"
                                                            ↓
                                                    "query failed"
```

## Test Results (114 tests run)
- ✅ **AIGenerator**: 25/25 passed (100% - tool calling works correctly)
- ⚠️ **CourseSearchTool**: 10/12 passed (83% - fails due to MAX_RESULTS=0)
- ❌ **VectorStore**: 2/40 passed (5% - many test setup issues + MAX_RESULTS bug)
- ⚠️ **RAGSystem**: 19/27 passed (70% - integration issues due to MAX_RESULTS=0)

## Required Fixes

### IMMEDIATE (Critical)
1. **Fix MAX_RESULTS in config.py**
   ```python
   # Change from:
   MAX_RESULTS: int = 0
   # To:
   MAX_RESULTS: int = 5  # or any positive number
   ```

### RECOMMENDED (Important)
2. **Add config validation** to prevent similar issues
3. **Fix VectorStore test mocking** for better test coverage
4. **Add integration tests** to catch config issues early

## Verification Steps
1. Fix MAX_RESULTS in config.py
2. Run the new integration tests to verify fix
3. Test actual queries through the web interface
4. Confirm sources are now properly returned

## Impact Assessment
- **Before Fix**: All content queries return "query failed"
- **After Fix**: Normal RAG functionality should be restored
- **User Experience**: Immediate improvement in query success rate

## Prevention Measures
1. Add config validation on startup
2. Include integration tests in CI/CD
3. Monitor search result counts in production
4. Add alerts for empty search results

## Confidence Level: HIGH
The tests conclusively demonstrate that MAX_RESULTS=0 is the primary cause of the "query failed" issue. Fixing this single configuration value should resolve the main problem.
